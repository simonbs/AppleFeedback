# The Passwords preference pane cannot import passwords that contain a quotation mark

Attempting to import a CSV file with passwords that contain a quotation mark will cause the import to fail and the Passwords preference pane to import zero items.

Consider the following sample CSV file (also attached to the issue).

```csv
Title,Url,Username,Password
"Apple","https://apple.com","hello@example.com","super\"secret"
```

The file contains a single username and password for apple.com.

Username: hello@example.com

Password: super"secret

The password contains a quotation mark which has been escaped in the file because values are surrounded by quotation marks. Iâ€™ve also tried not escaping the quotation mark but unsurprisingly that also causes the import to fail.
