# Third-party API for creating dynamic wallpapers like the Weather and Astronomy wallpapers

There should be an API for third-party developers to offer dynamic wallpapers like the Weather and Astronomy wallpapers in iOS 16.

This could let third-party weather apps, photo apps, and other media apps provide new and elegant wallpapers for users. Furthermore this opens up for a completely new app category of apps that display art, possibly generated in code, on the Lock Screen.
