# The Earth seems misaligned on the Astronomy wallpaper in iOS 16

The Earth doesnâ€™t have the same placement on the Astronomy wallpaper when customizing the wallpaper and after it has been set. The alignment should be the same.

The Earth looks misaligned when the wallpaper has been set while it looks correct while customizing the wallpaper.

It looks like the extra space at the bottom could be to accommodate notifications, however, then I think the additional space should also be present when customizing the wallpaper. Or even better, the Earth should move up and down depending on whether there are any notifications.
