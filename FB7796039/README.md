# Intents UI is automatically dismissed after being presented for a few seconds

When running a shortcut that presents a UI (that is, the intent has an intents UI extension), the UI is automatically dismissed after being on the screen for just a few seconds (3-4 seconds). This is new in iOS 14 and significantly limits what the intents UI can be used for.

Please see the attached video which shows how long the UI is presented. The attached sample project includes Shortcuts action being run in the video.
